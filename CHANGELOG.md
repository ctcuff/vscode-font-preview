# Change Log

# 2.1.0 - 2022/7/9

This version requires VS Code 1.56.0+

## Features

- There's now an option to use a worker when lading a font. If enabled, VS Code will use a worker to create a base64 version of the font that can be rendered using `@font-face`. This setting can be enabled in the settings UI or in JSON with:
  ```js
  {
    "font-preview.useWorker": <boolean> // true by default
  }
  ```
- The glyph inspector now has toggles that can enable/disable certain rendering options

    </div>

## Enhancements

- A `@font-face` style will no longer be created for fonts greater than 30 MB since they can't be rendered by Chromium in the first place (this speeds up font loading times as well)
- A loading indicator now displays in the status bar when a font is loading
- VS Code will show an error message in the editor area when a font fails to load
- The glyph inspector modal is a little bit more responsive when resizing the viewport
- Upgraded a few dependencies to path security issues

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug causing the baseline to display on top of the glyph
- Fixed a bug causing glyphs to be rendered twice

# 2.0.0 - 2022/7/4

## Features

- Fonts can now be copied as an SVG
- Fonts as large as 25MB can now be loaded ([#3](https://github.com/ctcuff/vscode-font-preview/issues/3)) (_**NOTE**: Web fonts larger than 30MB can be parsed but cannot be rendered as a displayable font face_ [Chromium source here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/refs/heads/main/Source/platform/fonts/opentype/OpenTypeSanitizer.cpp#70))
- Added a modal that displays ascender, descender, baseline, and other information about a glyph from the `hhea` and `head` tables ([#4](https://github.com/ctcuff/vscode-font-preview/issues/4))
- The `Glyph`, `Features`, and `License` tabs now work for WOFF2 fonts
