    Apparently motionless to her passengers and crew, the Interplanetary
    liner Hyperion bored serenely onward through space at normal
    acceleration. In the railed-off sanctum in one corner of the control
    room a bell tinkled, a smothered whirr was heard, and Captain Bradley
    frowned as he studied the brief message upon the tape of the recorder--a
    message flashed to his desk from the operator's panel. He beckoned, and
    the second officer, whose watch it now was, read aloud: "Reports of
    scout patrols still negative." "Still negative." The officer scowled in
    thought. "They've already searched beyond the widest possible location
    of the wreckage, too. Two unexplained disappearances inside a
    month--first the Dione, then the Rhea--and not a plate nor a lifeboat
    recovered. Looks bad, sir. One might be an accident; two might possibly
    be a coincidence...." His voice died away. What might that coincidence
    mean?

    "But at three it would get to be a habit," the captain finished the
    thought. "And whatever happened, happened quick. Neither of them had
    time to say a word--their location recorders simply went dead. But of
    course they didn't have our detector screens nor our armament. According
    to the observatories we're in clear ether, but I wouldn't trust them
    from Tellus to Luna. You have given the new orders, of course?" "Yes,
    sir. Detectors full out, all three courses of defensive screen on the
    trips, projectors manned, suits on the hooks. Every object detected in
    the outer space to be investigated immediately--if vessels, they are to
    be warned to stay beyond extreme range. Anything entering the fourth
    zone is to be rayed." "Right--we are going through!"

    Leaving the captain's desk, the watch officer resumed his tour of duty.
    The six great lookout plates into which the alert observers peered were
    blank, their far-flung ultra-sensitive detector screens encountering no
    obstacle--the ether was empty for thousands upon thousands of
    kilometers. The signal lamps upon the pilot's panel were dark, its
    warning bells were silent. A brilliant point of white in the center of
    the pilot's closely ruled micrometer grating, exactly upon the
    cross-hairs of his directors, showed that the immense vessel was
    precisely upon the calculated course, as laid down by the automatic
    integrating course-plotters. Everything was quiet and in order.

    "All's well, sir," he reported briefly to Captain Bradley—but all was not well.
    Danger—more serious by far in that it was not external—was even then, all
    unsuspected, gnawing at the great ship's vitals. In a locked and shielded
    compartment, deep down in the interior of the liner, was the great air purifier. Now
    a man leaned against the primary duct—the aorta through which flowed the stream of
    pure air supplying the entire vessel. This man, grotesque in full panoply of space
    armor, leaned against the duct, and as he leaned a drill bit deeper and deeper into
    the steel wall of the pipe. Soon it broke through, and the slight rush of air was
    stopped by the insertion of a tightly fitting rubber tube. The tube terminated in a
    heavy rubber balloon, which surrounded a frail glass bulb. The man stood tense, one
    hand holding before his silica-and-steel-helmeted head a large pocket chronometer,
    the other lightly grasping the balloon. A sneering grin was upon his face as he
    waited the exact second of action—the carefully predetermined instant when his right
    hand, closing, would shatter the fragile flask and force its contents into the
    primary air stream of the Hyperion!
